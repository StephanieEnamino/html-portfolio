<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello there, I'm Stephanie Enamino, a dedicated Aeronautical Engineering student with a fervent passion for coding. As someone who constantly seeks to explore the skies and beyond, I find myself equally captivated by the world of programming. My journey began with a curiosity that quickly turned into a full-blown fascination, leading me to dive headfirst into the realms of coding.
</p>
<p> Balancing my love for aeronautics with my enthusiasm for coding, I embarked on a new adventure: creating my very first project using HTML. Through this project, I had the chance to meld my two passions, crafting a digital experience that reflects my unique blend of interests. It's a small step in the grand scheme of things, but it symbolizes the intersection of my dreams and aspirations.
</p>
<p>As I navigate the challenges of my engineering studies, I also eagerly embrace the opportunities to further develop my coding skills. This project marks the beginning of what I hope will be a remarkable journey in the world of coding, as I strive to merge innovation with precision, much like in aeronautics.
</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to explore my humble HTML project. Your appreciation means the world to me. Here's to embracing new horizons and soaring to greater heights in both engineering and coding!</p>
